## Make a change

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository! :smiley:

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a comment to the issue, (and this might mean making a new issue).

    Check in with one of the Coding foundation development team to ensure you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

    [This blog][link_pushpullblog] is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

2. [Fork][link_fork] the [Coding foundation][link_codingfound] to your profile.

    You can now do whatever you want with this copy of the project. You won't mess up anyone else's work so you're super safe.

    Make sure to [keep your fork up to date][link_updateupstreamwiki] with the master repository.

3. Make the changes you've discussed.

    Try to keep the changes focused rather than changing lots of things at once. If you feel tempted to branch out then please *literally* branch out: create [separate branches][link_branches] for different updates to make the next step much easier!

4. Submit a [pull request][link_pullrequest].

    A member of the executive team will review your changes, have a bit of discussion and hopefully merge them in!  
    N.B. you don't have to be ready to merge to make a pull request! We encourage you to submit a pull request as early as you want to. They help us to keep track of progress and help you to get earlier feedback.

**Success!!** :sparkles:
