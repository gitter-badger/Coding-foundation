## What do you do?
I am a PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Zurich. 
I develop statistical methods for the analysis of clinical trials. All of these methods
need to be implemented in a program, so that others can use them. For that I use R.


## How did you get interested in STEM?
I always liked maths and since my dad was very good at explaining, I was 
also quite good at it. After a failed attempt to study music therapy, I 
decided I should do something I am good at and so I chose statistics 
(maths was too theoretical for me).

## What is the thing you enjoy the most of your job?
I really enjoy my work because I get to focus on a very specific problem for a long
time and really think things through. Also I get to code a lot and go to many workshops,
conferences and hackathons. Once a year I teach an R programming class which is very
rewarding, because I can teach something that has helped me very much in my work and
that I enjoy doing.

## What did you struggle the most during your undergraduate studies?
Haha, funnily enough: Programming :satisfied:     
In my first programming course I was so frustrated that I cried.
I somehow got through it and now I love it and try to make it easier for my students
to learn programming.

## Do you have any role models?
My PhD supervisor and his wife. They are both stats professors and have two kids. 
My supervisor is a great researcher and teacher. I learned a lot from him.

Also Erin LeDell is someone I look up to. She is very much into machine learning and open 
source. Also she is very active in supporting women's groups like [R Ladies](https://rladies.org) 
and [WiMLDS](http://wimlds.org/).

## What advice or tips would you like to give to people interested in a career in STEM?
Do it! And don't be intimitated by all the men. They are people (with flaws) too ;)
