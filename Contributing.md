## What should I need to know before getting started?
All ideas are welcome, we aim to make this a collaborative and inclusive project.

We have a [Code of Conduct](./codeofconduct.md). Please make sure you read it first ðŸ™‚.

## What's already been done and what is underway?
The whole project will be done in the open and all of the outstanding tasks can
be found as GitHUb issues as well as identified in the project.

The more urgent tasks will be labelled as **critical** and those for which we
really really need external help will be marked as **help-wanted**.

If you find any issues that you feel you can help with please make a fork of the
project, get working and submit your pull request.
